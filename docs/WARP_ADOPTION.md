# 📢 WARP.md Documentation Now Live

## 🎯 What This Means for Engineers

The **BoyFanz-3** repository now has comprehensive development documentation in `WARP.md` that establishes our standard workflows, compliance requirements, and operational procedures.

### 🚀 Key Benefits
- **Standardized Workflows**: All dev operations through `warp run` commands
- **Quality Gates**: Automated checks for security, accessibility, and compliance
- **Adult Industry Compliance**: Enforced adult-friendly infrastructure and payment processors
- **Creator-First Standards**: Every feature must benefit creators

### 📋 Required Actions

#### For All Engineers:
1. **Read the documentation**: [WARP.md](../WARP.md)
2. **Use standardized commands**: 
   - `warp run dev:start` / `warp run dev:stop`
   - `warp run qa:check` before pushing
   - `warp run a11y:scan` for accessibility testing
3. **Follow the preflight checklist** before starting work

#### For Pull Requests:
- ✅ **WARP.md checkbox is now mandatory** in PR template
- Confirm documentation accuracy or update as needed
- CI will **fail if WARP.md or .warp/workflows.yaml are missing**

### 🛠️ Development Flow Changes

**Before** (manual, inconsistent):
```bash
npm start
kill -9 $(lsof -ti:3000)  # Manual port cleanup
```

**Now** (standardized, reliable):
```bash
warp run dev:start       # Auto env check, port cleanup
warp run dev:stop        # Clean shutdown
```

### 🔒 Compliance Enforcement

Our CI now automatically verifies:
- WARP documentation exists and is current
- No banned payment processors (Stripe/PayPal)
- Security, accessibility, and quality standards
- Adult-industry compliant infrastructure only

### ❓ Questions or Issues?

- **Documentation**: Check [WARP.md](../WARP.md) first
- **Workflow Questions**: See `.warp/workflows.yaml` for all available commands
- **Compliance Issues**: Review the adult-industry standards in WARP.md
- **Support**: Use the standard development workflows or reach out to the team

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Familiarize yourself** with the new workflows
2. **Update your local environment** to use `warp run` commands
3. **Review upcoming PRs** for WARP.md compliance
4. **Share feedback** on workflow improvements
